## _Introduction_

Hello Kachikawawa

Hello Aquamarine

Hello Ashish



Hello there! If you are here for the **first time**, then welcome!

We have many things awaiting for you such as:

- Formatted commands
- Clean files
- Sorted in alphabetical orders

## _Getting started_

To get started, we have a few files amd commands below

- commands/
- public /
- views /
- .env
- README.md
- config.json
- package.json
- server.js

## commands/
Since we use a command handler, all our command goes here!

## public/
This is reserved when a web will be made! Please ask Ashish for assistance!

## views/
Same as `public/`

## .env
We use it to store secrets, but `config.json` will do the trick!

## config.json
The details have been mentioned at `.env`!

## package.json
This is where we add all the packages for the discord bot to work!

## server.js
This is also where the magic happens! Without `package.json` and `server.js`, there just wouldnt be a discord bot!
